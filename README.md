## 📗 DESCRIPTION

This mod gives you true fullbright by overriding Minecraft’s brightness cap (raised from 100 to 1500). It removes all darkness and shadows, making everything fully lit — regardless of time, biome, or dimension.

## 🧩 USAGE

* Press `B` to toggle between max brightness and previous brightness.
